      Meetings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meetings are on the first Wednesday of every month, at 7pm Eastern Time (New York Time), and are conducted on Jitsi. To join in, use Chromium
      or Google Chrome and go to <a href="https://meet.jit.si/golug">https://meet.jit.si/golug</a>.

    <h2>
      Meeting Audio Best Practices
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jitsi meetings can degenerate quickly with excess background noise, echos, and the like. We've seen even one participant in a noisy environment
      degrade the audio for the entire meeting. Here are the audio best practices ,which, if followed by everyone, renders a clear and pleasant
      listening experience for all:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>On many distros, audio can't be made to work in Firefox. If so, Chromium is the browser of choice.
      </li>
      <li>Adjust your mike level to be just sensitive enough to have you heard full volume, but not enough that background noise comes through.
      </li>
      <li>If possible, listen through headphones, not speakers. Speakers create feedback and cause other listening problems. If you <em>must</em>
      listen through speakers, keep their volume as low as possible and keep them away from the microphone. Listening through laptop speakers with
      the laptop microphone enabled is a sure way to have echo, noises, and audio artifacts, so if you're using a laptop, please mute your mike
      except when talking.
      </li>
      <li>If possible, use a real microphone rather than the built-in laptop microphone. The built in microphones are usually multidirectional and
      much too far from your mouth to distinguish between your voice and background sound.
      </li>
      <li>Keep your audio muted except when you need to talk. In Jitsi, you can mute and unmute your mike just by clicking on the microphone icon on
      the bottom near the center.
      </li>
      <li>Arrive a few minutes early to iron out audio problems you might have.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Other Meeting Best Practices
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some presenters feel better when you leave your camera on so the presenter can gauge your level of interest and tweak the presentation
      accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>When the presenter shares his/her screen, if the letters or graphics are blurry, increase your Jitsi video resolution. Just click the three
      dots on the bottom right, then select "Manage video quality", and use the slider to increase the video quality until letters being presented
      are clear.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium is an absolute pig, and uses up CPU faster than a random number generator. You can make the best of a bad situation:
        <ul>
          <li>Have only your Jitsi session open in Chromium: No other tabs. No other instances of Chromium.
          </li>
          <li>Clear Chromium's cache by browsing (in Chromium) to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData .
          </li>
          <li>Run Chromium at a high priority, like<br>
            nice -n -18 chromium<br>
            Running it at a high priority minimizes sound dropouts and screen freezes.
          </li>
          <li>If possible, close out all Firefox sessions. Firefox is a little less of a pig, but piggy enough to gobble some CPU.
          </li>
          <li>Close unneeded programs.
          </li>
          <li>Hot tip: Run gkrelm to view CPU usage in real time.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please type your name or nickname into the name field when you join the meeting, so we don't refer to you as "fellow jitster" or "hey you".
      </li>
      <li>Most of these best practices are true for all conferencing software ,not just Jitsi.
      </li>
    </ul>
