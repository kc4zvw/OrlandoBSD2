<h2>
Statement on the Use of the BSD Daemon Figure:
</h2>
<hr>
The BSD Daemon is copyrighted by Marshall Kirk McKusick. Usage
of the daemon is permitted under the terms described below.
Several of the shirts shown in this web page were produced by
others after obtaining written permission to use the daemon.
The copyright of the derivative artwork remains with the shirt
producer; such copyrights are noted in the descriptive text
for the shirt.
<p>
Individuals may use the daemon for their personal use within the
bounds of good taste (an example of bad taste was a picture of the
BSD daemon blowtorching a Solaris logo). When reasonably possible,
I would like the text ``BSD Daemon Copyright 1988 by Marshall Kirk
McKusick. All Rights Reserved.'' to be included.  This text need
not be etched into the figure or garishly displayed when using the
daemon as say an Icon in a web frame. A good example of how
to handle the due credit in a web page is to create a link from
the daemon picture to the following text:
<pre>
    BSD Daemon Copyright 1988 by Marshall Kirk McKusick.
    All Rights Reserved.

    Permission to use the daemon may be obtained from:
	Marshall Kirk McKusick
	1614 Oxford St
	Berkeley, CA 94709-1608
	USA
    or via email at mckusick@mckusick.com

If you want to mass produce the daemon on Tshirts, CDROM's,
etc you need to request permission in advance. In general, I require
that the daemon be used in an appropriate way. This means that it
has to be something related to BSD and not expropriated as a company
logo (though I do allow companies with BSD-based products such as
Scotgold or WindRiver to use it).  I regret having to be so
legalistic about the daemon, but I almost lost the daemon to a
certain large company because I failed to show due dilligence in
protecting it. So, I've taken due dilligence seriously since then.
